###  R Project Updates

Updates from [R Core](http://developer.r-project.org/blosxom.cgi/R-devel/NEWS):

+ Command line completion on `::` now also includes lazy loaded data.

+ `seq.POSIXt(*, by = "<n> DSTdays")` now should work correctly in all cases and is faster. (PR#17342)

+ On Windows, `file.rename` internally retries the operation in case of error to recover from possible anti-virus interference.

+ `on.exit()` gains an optional argument `after` with default `TRUE`. Using `after = FALSE` with `add = TRUE` adds an exit expression on top of any existing ones. This way the expressions are run in a first in last out fashion. From Lionel Henry.

+ `sys.on.exit()` is now always evaluated in the right frame. From Lionel Henry.

+ The order of selection of OpenMP flags has been changed: Oracle Developer Studio 12.5 accepts `-fopenmp` and `-xopenmp` but only the latter enables OpenMP so it is now tried first.

+ `fisher.test(*, workspace = <n>)` now may also increase the internal stack size which allows larger problem to be solved, fixing PR#1662. Additionally, fixing PR#16654, a typo has been corrected which made the `hybrid=TRUE` method never be different than the default.

+ The methods package no longer directly copies slots (attributes) into a prototype that is of an ‚Äúabnormal‚Äù (reference) type, like a symbol.

+ The methods package no longer attempts to call `length<-()` on `NULL` (during the bootstrap process).

+ The methods package correctly shows methods when there are multiple methods with the same signature for the same generic (still not fully supported, but at least the user can see them).
