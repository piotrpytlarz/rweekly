### R Project Updates

Updates from [R Core](http://developer.r-project.org/blosxom.cgi/R-devel/NEWS):

+ If a reference class has a validity method, `validObject` will be called automatically from the default initialization method for reference classes.

+ `xtabs()` works more consistently with `NA`s, also in its result no longer setting them to `0`. Further, a new logical option `addNA` allows to count `NA`s where appropriate.

+ `dev.capture()` using Quartz Cocoa device (macOS) returned invalid components if the back-end chose to use ARGB instead of RGBA image format.

+ Header `Rconfig.h` no longer defines `SUPPORT_OPENMP`; instead use `_OPENMP` (as documented for a long time).
