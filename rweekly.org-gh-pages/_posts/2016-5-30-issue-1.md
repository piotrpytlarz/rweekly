## R Project Updates

Updates from [R Core](http://developer.r-project.org/blosxom.cgi/R-devel/NEWS).

1. `identical()` gets an `ignore.srcref` option which drops `"srcref"` and similar attributes when true (as by default).

2. `diag(x, n=.)` now preserves `typeof(x)`, also for logical, integer and raw `x` (and as previously for complex and numeric).

3. `diag(x, nrow = n)` now preserves `typeof(x)`, also for logical, integer and raw `x` (and as previously for complex and numeric).

4. `smooth.spline()` now allows to specify lambda directly, gets a `hatvalues()` method and keeps `tol` in result.

5. `str()` and `strOptions()` get a new option `drop.deparse.attr` with improved but _changed_ default behaviour for expressions. For `expression` objects `x`, `str(x)` now may remove extraneous white space and truncate long lines.
