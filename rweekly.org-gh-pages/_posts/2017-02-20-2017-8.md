### Call for Participation

+ [Apply to attend rOpenSci unconf 2017!](https://ropensci.org/blog/blog/2017/02/02/unconf2017) - For a fourth year running, rOpenSci is excited to announce another unconference in 2017 with a new venue in ‚òÄ Downtown LA. We're organizing this event to bring together scientists, developers, and open data enthusiasts from academia, industry, government, and non-profit to get together for a few days and hack on various projects.

### R Project Updates

+ [Performance improvements coming to R 3.4.0](http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2017/02/preview-r-340.html)

Updates from [R Core](http://developer.r-project.org/blosxom.cgi/R-devel/NEWS):

+ `R CMD check --as-cran` now NOTEs if the package does not register its native routines or does not declare its intentions on (native) symbol search. (This will become a WARNING in due course.)

+  Those who use proxies should check that their settings are compatible (see `?download.file`: the most commonly used forms work for both methods `"internal"` and `"libcurl"`).

+ One can now choose from alternative matrix product implementations via `options(matprod = )`. The `"internal"` implementation is not optimized for speed but consistent in precision with other summations in R (uses `long double` accumulators). `"blas"` calls BLAS directly for best speed, yet usually with undefined behavior for inputs with NaN/Inf.

+ (Unix-alike) The default method for `download.file()` and `url()` now always chooses `"libcurl"` except for `file://` URLs. There will be small changes in the format and wording of messages, and those who use proxies should check that their settings are compatible (see `?download.file`: the most commonly used forms work for both methods `"internal"` and `"libcurl"`).

+ Three changes when redirection of a `http://` URL to a `https://` URL is encountered.

+ (Unix-alike) For `http://` URLs and the default method (`"auto"`), `download.file()` switches to `method = "libcurl"` if a redirection to a `https://` URL is encountered.

+ For `url()` with method `"default"` and an explicit `open` argument, if opening fails because of redirection to an `https://` URL then `method = "libcurl"` is tried.


### Upcoming Events
