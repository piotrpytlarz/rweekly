###  R Project Updates

Updates from [R Core](http://developer.r-project.org/blosxom.cgi/R-devel/NEWS):

+ Buffering is disabled for `file()` connections to irregular files (like sockets), as well as `fifo()` and `pipe()` connections. Fixes PR#17470, reported by Chris Culnane.

+ Analogously, the tools-internal function called from `R CMD check` gets a `warnOption = 1` argument and uses the larger of that and `getOption("warn")`, also allowing to be run with increased warning level.

+ `getOption()` is more efficient notably for the rare case when called with two arguments, from several contributors in PR#17394.

+ `tools`' `vignetteDepends()` has been deprecated (it called a function deprecated since Feb 2016), partly replaced by newly exported `vignetteInfo()`.

+ Experimentally, setting environment variable `_R_CHECK_LENGTH_1_LOGIC2_` will lead to warnings (or errors if the variable is set to a `true` value) when `&&` or `||` encounter and use arguments of length more than one.

+ Added `"lines"` and `"chars"` coordinate systems to `grconvertX()` and `grconvertY()`.

+ `S3method()` directives in `NAMESPACE` can now also be used to perform _delayed_ S3 method registration.
