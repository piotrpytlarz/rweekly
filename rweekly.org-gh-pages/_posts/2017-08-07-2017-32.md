###  R Project Updates

Updates from [R Core](http://developer.r-project.org/blosxom.cgi/R-devel/NEWS):

+ `lower.tri(x)` and `upper.tri(x)` only needing `dim(x)` now work via new `.row()` `.col()` and no longer call `as.matrix()` by default in order to work efficiently for all kind of matrix-like objects.

+ `type.convert()` becomes a generic, with additional methods that operate recursively over list and `data.frame` objects. Courtesy of Arni Magnusson (PR#17269).

+ Setting `options(device = *)` to an invalid function no longer segfaults when plotting is initiated. (PR#15883)

+ `encodeString(<very large string>)` no longer segfaults. (PR#15885)

+ Construction of `names()` for very large objects in `c()` and `unlist()` now works, thanks to Suharto Anggono's patch proposals in PR#17292.

+  `callNextMethod()` works for `...` methods. 

+ `qr.coef(qd, y)` now has correct names also when `qd` is a complex QR or stems from `qr(*, LAPACK=TRUE)`.
