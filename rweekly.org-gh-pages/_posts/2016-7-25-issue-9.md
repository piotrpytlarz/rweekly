## R Project Updates

Updates from [R Core](http://developer.r-project.org/blosxom.cgi/R-devel/NEWS).

+ `configure` now adds a compiler switch for C++11 code, even if the compiler supports C++11 by default. (This ensures that â€˜gccâ€™ 6.x uses C++11 mode and not its default C++14 mode.)

+ There is support for compiling C++14 code in packages on suitable platforms: see `Writing R Extensions` for how to request this.

+ Running `R CMD check --as-cran` with `_R_CHECK_CRAN_INCOMING_REMOTE_` false now skips tests that require remote access. The remaining (local) tests typically run very quickly compared to the remote tests.
