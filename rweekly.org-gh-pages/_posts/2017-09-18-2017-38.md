###  R Project Updates

Updates from [R Core](http://developer.r-project.org/blosxom.cgi/R-devel/NEWS):

+ `fisher.test(*, workspace = <n>)` now may also increase the internal stack size which allows larger problem to be solved, fixing PR#1662. Additionally, fixing PR#16654, a typo has been corrected which made the `hybrid=TRUE` method never be different than the default.

+ The methods package no longer directly copies slots (attributes) into a prototype that is of an ‚Äúabnormal‚Äù (reference) type, like a symbol.

+ The methods package no longer attempts to call `length<-()` on `NULL` (during the bootstrap process).

+ The methods package correctly shows methods when there are multiple methods with the same signature for the same generic (still not fully supported, but at least the user can see them).

+ `deparse(x)` now also uses `backtick = TRUE` by default for the case where `x` is a symbol, and hence `deparse(quote(`{`), control="all")` is parseable now.

+ `splineDesign(.., derivs = 4)` no longer segfaults.

+ The object header layout has been changed to support merging the `ALTREP` branch. This requires re-installing packages that use compiled code.

+ Attributes on symbols are now detected and prevented; attempt to add an attribute to a symbol results in an error.

+ Dispatch on `...` calls the method using its name, instead of `.Method` (for consistency with default dispatch), and only attempts to pass non-missing arguments from the generic.

+ `array(character(), 1)` now gives (a 1D array with) `NA` as has been documented for a long time as in the other cases of zero-length array initialization and also compatibly with `matrix(character(), *)`. As mentioned there, this also fixes PR#17333.
